# Zafiro icons 
zafiro icons is a icon pack for desktop xfce4 or lxde, with clean and simple design lines, inspired by flat desing. 
the priority is minimalism, we do not saturate elements with any icon,
each icon is given the time necessary to achieve a good job

*if you find any missing application icon please report it to me,
at the moment I only accept report of icons of missing applications,
It is my knowledge that in the other categories there are some missing to add.*
